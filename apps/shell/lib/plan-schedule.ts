// apps/shell/lib/plan-schedule.ts
// Turns a plan's days into concrete calendar dates (SHAN-473, Phase 4 of
// SHAN-467). Pure: no clock, no DB, no randomness — feed it a plan and a date
// range and it answers the same thing every time, which is what makes both the
// ICS feed and the frontend calendar trustworthy.
//
// The rules, in one place because Phase 3 guessed at them:
//   * A day with a pinned `weekday` runs on that weekday, every week.
//   * A day with `weekday === null` is floating. Floating days rotate through
//     whatever weekly slots are left over, so a 3-day plan running 2×/week goes
//     D1,D2 · D3,D1 · D2,D3 — the A/B/A shape a real program has, instead of
//     Phase 3's "no weekday match, so fall back to day one" every single day.
//   * How many slots a week: `daysPerWeek`, falling back to the number of days.
//   * Which weekdays those slots land on: SPREAD_PREFERENCE minus the weekdays
//     the pinned days already own, so sessions stay spaced out.
//
// The rotation ordinal is anchored on `startDate` (or a fixed epoch Monday when
// the plan has none) so the phase of the rotation never drifts.
//
// NOTE: this file is mirrored at shaneBackend/src/modules/practice/plan-schedule.ts,
// where the ICS feed uses it. Cross-repo imports are banned, so the two copies
// have to be kept in step by hand — change one, change the other.
